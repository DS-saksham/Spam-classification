# 📧 Spam Classification

This repository contains a complete **Spam Classification system** built using machine learning techniques.  
The primary goal of this project is to automatically detect and classify messages as either **spam** or **ham (non-spam)**.

## 📂 Repository Contents

The following files and folders are included in the repository to facilitate the classification process:

- **Sms_spam_detection.ipynb**  
  The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for building, training, and testing the machine learning model.

- **spam.csv**  
  The dataset used for training and evaluating the spam classification system.

- **Vectorization.txt**  
  A supporting file containing details or parameters related to the text vectorization process used for machine learning.

- **.ipynb_checkpoints/**  
  Internal folder used by Jupyter Notebook to track progress and checkpoints.
